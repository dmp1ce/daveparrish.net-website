		<h1>About</h1>
                <p>I also maintain a bunch of obscure open source projects.</p>
<h2 id="family">Family</h2>
<p>My most important project is my family. I spend as much time as I can with my wife and children. I figured out how I could work from home, partly to spend more time with my family.</p>
<h2 id="health-fitness">Health &amp; Fitness</h2>
<p>I have been into fitness since the 1990s when I was involved in cross country and track sports. I was convinced that regular exercise was an important part of health for the human body. Although, 20 years later I learned that nutrition is an equally, if not more, important part of health. I learned this lesson because of chronic respiratory problems I was having, which was only cured by changing my diet to a diet which more closely conforms to what ancient humans might have eaten. Much of my understanding about this new way of eating is from the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Paleo-Nutshell-Living-Eating-Intended/dp/0757004504">Paleo in a Nutshell: Living and Eating the Way Nature Intended</a>.</p>
<h2 id="philosophy-and-self-knowledge">Philosophy and self knowledge</h2>
<p>Through much of my early life I had little understanding of philosophy and I had even less knowledge about myself. I was disconnected with my own emotions and I didn’t know what made me happy. After several bouts of mild depression due to unfulfilling jobs and relationships, I was finally about to begin making some decisions in my life which I believe lead me to a more sustainable and happy life.</p>
<p>I feel like I owe this change to several online resources and books including <a href="http://www.freedomainradio.com/">Freedomain Radio</a>, <a href="http://completeliberty.com/">Complete Liberty</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Six-Pillars-Self-Esteem-Definitive/dp/0553374397">Nathanal Branden’s The Six Pillars of Self Esteem</a>. I am also lucky to have had supportive friends and family while I made changes which surely challenged (threatened) their own beliefs.</p>
<p>I look forward to sharing, with those close in my life, strategies on how to communicate with each other in such a way that we are constantly trying to achieve happiness in each of our lives. This can sometimes be a challenge as many feel they can only get their needs met at the expense of another.</p>
<h2 id="gaming">Gaming</h2>
<p>When I have time I enjoy gaming but not playing much at the moment. I do however have time to listen to Video Game Music while I’m working which I really enjoy. One of my favorite shows is <a href="http://kngi.org/category/past-episodes-gamefuel/">Game Fuel</a>.</p>
<h2 id="linux">Linux</h2>
<p>I’m a linux fanboy. Mostly because I am dedicated to the idea of open source. I try to run all my devices on open source software and I try to stay up to date on new open source technologies. Right now I am running Arch Linux on my laptop. Before that I ran Gentoo, which was quite a learning experience.</p>
